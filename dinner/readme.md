    Heat oil in wok or large heavy based skillet over high heat.
    Add garlic and chilli and cook for 10 seconds. Don't inhale - the chilli will make you cough!
    Add onion, cook for 1 minute. 
    Add chicken and fish sauce, and fry until cooked, around 2 minutes.
    Add green onion, noodles and sauce and cook for 1 minute until the sauce reduces and coats the noodles.
